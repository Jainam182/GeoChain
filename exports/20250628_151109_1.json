    "cot_reasoning": "The query \"Flood Map of Mumbai\" requests a visualization of areas in Mumbai susceptible to flooding.  Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **What the query is asking for:** A spatial representation (map) showing the areas within Mumbai that are prone to flooding. This implies areas with high flood risk.\n\n2. **Geospatial concepts involved:**  Hydrology (water flow, drainage), terrain (elevation, slope), possibly population density (to understand potential impact).\n\n3. **Datasets required:**\n    * **Elevation data:** A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of Mumbai.  This is crucial for determining areas of low-lying land and potential water accumulation.  High-resolution data is preferred for accuracy.  Sources could include SRTM, ASTER GDEM, or locally sourced LiDAR data.\n    * **Hydrological data:**  Rainfall data (historical rainfall patterns and intensity), river/drainage network data (shapefile or raster). This helps identify areas prone to inundation from rivers or heavy rainfall.  Sources could be weather stations, hydrological models, or government agencies.\n    * **Land use/land cover data:** This helps to understand the impact of different land cover types on flood risk (e.g., impervious surfaces increase runoff).  Sources could be satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel) classified into land use categories.\n    * **Mumbai city boundary:** A shapefile defining the administrative boundary of Mumbai is needed to clip the flood map to the city limits.\n\n4. **Why each dataset is needed:**\n    * **DEM:** To identify low-lying areas that are most susceptible to flooding.\n    * **Hydrological data:** To model the flow of water and identify areas most likely to be inundated based on rainfall and drainage patterns.\n    * **Land use/land cover data:** To understand how different land cover types influence flood risk and to refine the flood risk assessment.\n    * **City boundary:** To limit the analysis to the area of interest (Mumbai).\n\n5. **Tools:**\n    * **GDAL:** For raster data manipulation (e.g., clipping, reprojection, raster calculations).\n    * **WhiteboxTools:** For hydrological modeling (e.g., flow accumulation, watershed delineation), terrain analysis (e.g., slope calculation).\n    * **QGIS or ArcGIS:** For data visualization and map creation.  These GIS software packages provide a user interface to manage and visualize the data and results.\n\n6. **Workflow construction:** The workflow will involve pre-processing the datasets (reprojection, clipping), hydrological modeling using the DEM and rainfall data to determine flood-prone areas, and finally visualizing the results on a map.  Assumptions will be made about rainfall intensity and return periods, which should be clearly stated in the final product.\n\n7. **Assumptions and caveats:**  The accuracy of the flood map depends heavily on the quality and resolution of the input datasets.  The model will likely be a simplified representation of reality and may not capture all aspects of flooding (e.g., tidal effects, dam failures).  The choice of rainfall intensity and return period will significantly influence the results.",
    "workflow_raw": "**WorkFlow:** This workflow will create a flood map of Mumbai by combining elevation data with hydrological information and land use data.  The process involves pre-processing the data, running a hydrological model to simulate flood extent, and visualizing the results on a map.\n\n**GDAL + WhiteboxTools Workflow:**\n\n1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Download DEM, rainfall data, drainage network data, land use data, and Mumbai city boundary shapefile. Reproject all datasets to a common coordinate system (e.g., UTM Zone 43N). Use `gdalwarp` for reprojection and `gdal_translate` for clipping to the Mumbai boundary.\n\n2. **Hydrological Modeling (WhiteboxTools):**\n    * Use `Fill depressions` to remove spurious pits in the DEM.\n    * Calculate flow direction using `D8 flow direction`.\n    * Calculate flow accumulation using `D8 flow accumulation`.\n    * Determine watershed boundaries using `Watershed`. (Optional, depending on the level of detail needed)\n    * (Optional) Incorporate rainfall data to model flood extent using a suitable hydrological model (e.g., a simplified model based on flow accumulation and rainfall intensity). This might require external scripting or integration with other tools.\n\n3. **Flood Risk Classification:**  Based on the flow accumulation (or the results of the hydrological model), classify the raster into flood risk zones (e.g., low, medium, high). This can be done using `Reclassify` in WhiteboxTools or using GDAL's `gdal_calc`.\n\n4. **Visualization (QGIS or ArcGIS):** Import the classified flood risk raster and the Mumbai city boundary shapefile into QGIS or ArcGIS. Symbolize the raster to represent the different flood risk zones. Add a basemap and create a visually appealing map showing the flood risk areas within Mumbai.  Include a legend and a clear title.\n\n5. **Output:** Export the final flood map as a suitable image format (e.g., PNG, JPG) and a geospatial format (e.g., GeoTIFF).  Include a report documenting the methodology, data sources, assumptions, and limitations."
