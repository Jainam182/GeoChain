GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) is an open-source library for reading and writing raster and vector geospatial data formats.

Key GDAL commands:
- gdalinfo: Shows metadata of raster files.
- gdal_translate: Converts raster data between formats.
- gdalwarp: Warps and reprojects raster data.

QGIS is a free and open-source desktop GIS application that uses GDAL/OGR for raster and vector data processing.

QGIS integrates GDAL by using it to read/write data formats like GeoTIFF, ESRI Shapefile, and PostGIS.

Example workflow:
1. Use gdal_translate to convert GeoTIFFs.
2. Load the output into QGIS for visualization or further processing.

Common issue:
- Missing .dll files can cause GDAL to fail in QGIS on Windows. Ensure that GDAL binaries are correctly added to PATH.
